#### Push to an s3 bucket and add as a helm repo (such as minio)
1. create a minio bucket
2. package the helm chart 
    ```helm package ./helm/whiteboard```

## API
Call your site with GET parameters to change the WhiteboardID or the Username

`http://YOURIP:8080?whiteboardid=MYID&username=MYNAME`

* whiteboardid => All people with the same ID are drawing on the same board
* username => The name witch is showing to others while drawing


## Things you may want to know
* Whiteboards are gone if you restart the Server, so keep that in mind (or save your whiteboard)
* This is just a sample layout to show the functions available
* You shoud be able to customize without ever toutching the whiteboard.js (take a look at index.html & main.js)

## ToDo
* Add feedback for errors and things ...

## Nginx Reverse Proxy configuration
Add this to your server part:
```
    location /whiteboard/ {
        proxy_set_header HOST $host;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection upgrade;
        proxy_pass http://YOURIP:8080/;
    }
```
To run it at /whiteboard. Don't forget to change -> YOURIP!

## Nextcloud integration
1. Install this app on your server
2. Enable and go to "external sites" on your Nextcloud
2. Add Link to your server: `https://YOURIP/whiteboard/?whiteboardid=WHITEBOARDNAME&username={uid}`
You can give each group its own whiteboard by changeing the WHITEBOARDNAME in the URL if you want.

Note: You might have to serve the app with https (If your nextcloud server runs https). To do so, its recommend to run this app behind a reverse proxy. (as shown above)
